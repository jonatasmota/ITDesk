# ITDesk
Helpdesk Application

I developed this application as a final project for a Database Programming class.

This application was created in Asp.net Core MVC and backend in C#. The user can register products, customers and incidents, as well as edit and delete them. The main idea is to be a Helpdesk, where the user registers the incidents and updates them according to the progress, being able to be adapted to different segments.
